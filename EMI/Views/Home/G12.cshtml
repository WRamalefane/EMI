    <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size:14pt;">
        Government of 12 is a visionary discipleship movement which we read about from the book of Matthew 28 : 18 - 20

        &quot;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and earth. Go therefore and make
        disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and
        the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with
        you always, even to the end of the age.
        &quot;
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size:14pt;">
        The scriptures teaches us that Jesus commanded whoever believes in him should make disciples,this involves pouring your life into someone's life and sharing all that you have learned with them just as your discipling leader is doing to you.Discipleship is therefore a movement of guidance,empowerment and equipping people to dwell into the holy life and obeying the commands that Jesus has given to us.
        The G12 movement teaches us to become selfless,loving and caring.It teaches us to help convey God's word and win more souls back to God.It is for growing people's faith and belief,trusting God without any fear and enjoying being in his presence.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size:14pt;">
        The G12 starts with a leader more especially a Pastor with 12 disciples who are also required to have their own G12 and lead them to the right direction.This movement is often seen 'influential' since leaders have to give teachings,directions and guidance on how to live a holy life and win more souls back to God.
    </p>
    <p style="font-family:'Montserrat';font-size:14pt;">
        The principle of 12 is therefore clear.Whatever other significance of the number 12 holds, it is the optimum number of intense and personal discipleship.This is shown by the Lord's example as well as the work of sociologists today who confirm this principle.
